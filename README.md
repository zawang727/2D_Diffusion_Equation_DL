# 2D_Diffusion_Equation_DL


2D_Diffusion_Generator is to calculate the diffusion equation cia iterative methods.
The generated data will feed into the DL.py to do the deep learning.
This method can dramatically decrease the calculation numerical simulation cost!

If you are interesting in this topic, I recommend you to take a look about the vedios on Youtube for channel "Two minutes paper"!
